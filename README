Simple fake device tree for AOSP.

This code enable a device named "hal9000". In order to build
this device, add a manifest in .repo/local_manifests/ with the lines

    <manifest>
    <project
      name="gipi/android_device_gipi_hal9000"
      path="device/gipi/hal9000"
      remote="github"
      revision="master"
      />
     </manifest>

and select from lunch menu the entry full_hal9000. If you want a minimal
system set

    BUILD_TINY_ANDROID := true
    
in full_hal9000.mk.

NOTE: the kernel is a fake one, this is a fake device
used only to test the build process involved in the AOSP.
