Simple fake device tree for AOSP.

This code enable a device named "hal9000". In order to build
this device, add a manifest in .repo/local_manifests/ with the lines

    <manifest>
        <remote
            name="github"
            fetch="git://github.com/"
        />
        <project
            name="gipi/android_device_gipi_hal9000"
            path="device/gipi/hal9000"
            remote="github"
            revision="master"
        />
    </manifest>
    

and select from lunch menu the entry full_hal9000. If you want a minimal
system set

    BUILD_TINY_ANDROID := true
    
in full_hal9000.mk.

NOTE: the kernel is a fake one, this is a fake device
used only to test the build process involved in the AOSP.

If like me you have a 32 bit system you can add a local manifest
like the following


  <remove-project name="platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-linux-androideabi-4.6"/>
  <project
    path="prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-linux-androideabi-4.6"
    name="yath/android_prebuilts_gcc_linux-x86-32_arm_arm-linux-androideabi-4.6"
    remote="github"
    revision="jellybean"
    />
